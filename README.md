# EphemSharp
**EphemSharp** is a **hobbyist, non-professional astronomy library for C#**.  
It allows you to compute basic ephemerides of stars and planets, as well as their apparent position in the sky for a given observer on Earth.

This project is created for **learning, experimentation, and personal projects**.
